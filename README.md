This is a debug module for screeps.com.
You can test it with the main.js.

Use it in you project with:
1. let Debug = require('Debug');
2. var debug = new Debug();
3. debug.report();

Contribute by adding code to support more classes. I plan to improve the module to add own methods to the profiler.
